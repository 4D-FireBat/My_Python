This repository will be where I record my Python learning.
My current plan is to use a number of different sources for learning this.
For starters, I'll be using a Python Programming for the Absolute Beginners by Michael Dawson. 
I will also be using a couple of online resources such as LinkedIn Learning and one or two of the courses on edX.org. 
I'm also new to Github, so this will be a learning process as well.
